pycalphad is a free and open-source Python library for
designing thermodynamic models, calculating phase diagrams and
investigating phase equilibria within the CALPHAD method. It
provides routines for reading Thermo-Calc TDB files and for
solving the multi-component, multi-phase Gibbs energy
minimization problem.

The purpose of this project is to provide any interested people
the ability to tinker with and improve the nuts and bolts of
CALPHAD modeling without having to be a computer scientist or
expert programmer.

For assistance in setting up your Python environment and/or
collaboration opportunities, please contact the author
by e-mail or using the issue tracker on GitHub.
