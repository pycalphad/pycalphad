  # NOTE: please try to keep any depedencies in alphabetic order so they may
  # be easily compared with other dependency lists
  # NOTE: these dependencies may differ in name from the conda-forge and
  # pycalphad Anaconda channels  from those on PyPI (i.e. those found in
  # `setup.py`). For example, conda-forge/symengine gives the C++ SymEngine
  # library, while conda-forge/python-symengine provides the Python package
  # called `symengine`.

  # phase_rec.FastFunction class implementation is coupled to SymEngine's
  # function pointer API, so we pin the version here.
