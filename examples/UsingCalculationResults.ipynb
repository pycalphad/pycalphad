    "## xarray Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Results returned from calling `calculate` or `equilibrium` in pycalphad are [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) Datasets. An xarray Dataset is a data structure that represents N-dimensional tabular data. It is an N-dimensional analog to the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through the structure of xarray Datasets in pycalphad and some basics of using them. For more in-depth tutorials and documentation on using xarray Datasets and DataArray's fully, see the [xarray documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Dataset stores the conditions that properties are calculated at and the values of the properties as a function of the different conditions. There are three key terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Dimensions`: these are the conditions that are calculated over, e.g. pressure (P) and temperature (T). They are essentially labels.\n",
    "* `Coordinates`: these are the actual *values* that are taken on by the dimensions. \n",
    "* `Data variables`: these are the properties calculated by pycalphad, such as the Gibbs energy, mixing energy, composition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `calculate()` results\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate is used to sample properties of a single phase. There are five dimensions/coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P`: pressures (in Pa).\n",
    "* `T`: temperatures (in K).\n",
    "* `component`: the string names of the components in the system\n",
    "* `internal_dof`: The internal_dof (internal degrees of freedom) is the index of the site in any phase's site fraction array. Below the FCC_A1 phase has the sublattice model (AL, ZN) and thus the internal_dof are integers 0 and 1 referring to the AL site (index 0) and the ZN site (index 1).\n",
    "* `points`: By default, the calculate function samples points over all of the internal degrees of freedom. Each coordinate point simply represents the index is a list of all configurations of the internal_dof sampled. There is no underlying physical meaning or order.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also at least four Data variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Phase`: The string name of the phase. For `calculate`, this will always be the phase name passed.\n",
    "* `X`: The composition of each component in mole fraction as a function of the temperature, pressure, and the index of the points (there is one composition for each point).\n",
    "* `Y`: The site fraction of each index in the internal_dof array for the given temperature, pressure and point.\n",
    "* `output`: \"output\" is always whatever property is calculated by the output keyword passed to `calculate`. The default is the molar Gibbs energy, GM. "

    "There are also at least six Data variables:\n",

    "* `Phase`: The string name of the phase in equilibrium at the conditions. There are as many as `len(vertex)` phases. Any time there are fewer phases in equilibrium than the indices described by `vertex`, the values of phase are paded by `''`, e.g. for a single phase region for FCC_A1, the values of Phase will be `['FCC_A1', '']`. When more than one phase is present, it is important to note that they are not necessarily sorted.\n",

    "* `MU`: The chemical potentials of each component for the conditions calculated.\n",
    "* `X`: The equilibrium composition of each element in each phase for the calculated conditions.\n",
    "* `Y`: The equilibrium site fraction of each site in each phase for the calculated conditions.\n",
    "* `GM`: Same as `output` for `calculate`. It is always reported no matter the value of `output`.\n",
    "* `output`: (optional) \"output\" is always whatever equilibrium property is calculated by the output keyword passed to `equilibrium`. Unlike `calculate`, this will be in addition to the `GM` because `GM` is always reported."
