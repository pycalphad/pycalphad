    "## xarray Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Results returned from calling `calculate` or `equilibrium` in pycalphad are [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) Datasets. An xarray Dataset is a data structure that represents N-dimensional tabular data. It is an N-dimensional analog to the Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk through the structure of xarray Datasets in pycalphad and some basics of using them. For more in-depth tutorials and documentation on using xarray Datasets and DataArray's fully, see the [xarray documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Dataset stores the conditions that properties are calculated at and the values of the properties as a function of the different conditions. There are three key terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Dimensions`: these are the conditions that are calculated over, e.g. pressure (P) and temperature (T). They are essentially labels.\n",
    "* `Coordinates`: these are the actual *values* that are taken on by the dimensions. \n",
    "* `Data variables`: these are the properties calculated by pycalphad, such as the Gibbs energy, mixing energy, composition, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `calculate()` results\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate is used to sample properties of a single phase. There are five dimensions/coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `P`: pressures (in Pa).\n",
    "* `T`: temperatures (in K).\n",
    "* `component`: the string names of the components in the system\n",
    "* `internal_dof`: The internal_dof (internal degrees of freedom) is the index of the site in any phase's site fraction array. Below the FCC_A1 phase has the sublattice model (AL, ZN) and thus the internal_dof are integers 0 and 1 referring to the AL site (index 0) and the ZN site (index 1).\n",
    "* `points`: By default, the calculate function samples points over all of the internal degrees of freedom. Each coordinate point simply represents the index is a list of all configurations of the internal_dof sampled. There is no underlying physical meaning or order.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also at least four Data variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Phase`: The string name of the phase. For `calculate`, this will always be the phase name passed.\n",
    "* `X`: The composition of each component in mole fraction as a function of the temperature, pressure, and the index of the points (there is one composition for each point).\n",
    "* `Y`: The site fraction of each index in the internal_dof array for the given temperature, pressure and point.\n",
    "* `output`: \"output\" is always whatever property is calculated by the output keyword passed to `calculate`. The default is the molar Gibbs energy, GM. "

    "* `X_ZN`: This is the composition of the species that was passed into the conditions array. Since we passed `v.X('ZN')` to the conditions dictionary, this is `X_ZN`. \n",

There will automatically be enough to describe the number of phases present in any equilibria calculated, implying that vertex can never be large enough to invalidate Gibbs phase rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also at least six Data variables:\n",

    "* `Phase`: The string name of the phase in equilibrium at the conditions. There are as many as `len(vertex)` phases. Any time there are fewer phases in equilibrium than the indices described by `vertex`, the values of phase are paded by `''`, e.g. for a single phase region for FCC_A1, the values of Phase will be `['FCC_A1', '']`. When more than one phase is present, it is important to note that they are not necessarily sorted.\n",
    "* `NP`: Phase fraction of each phase in equilibrium. When there is no other equilibrium phase (e.g. single phase `['FCC_A1', '']`) then the value of `NP` will be `nan` for the absence of a phase, rather than 0.\n",
    "* `MU`: The chemical potentials of each component for the conditions calculated.\n",
    "* `X`: The equilibrium composition of each element in each phase for the calculated conditions.\n",
    "* `Y`: The equilibrium site fraction of each site in each phase for the calculated conditions.\n",
    "* `GM`: Same as `output` for `calculate`. It is always reported no matter the value of `output`.\n",
    "* `output`: (optional) \"output\" is always whatever equilibrium property is calculated by the output keyword passed to `equilibrium`. Unlike `calculate`, this will be in addition to the `GM` because `GM` is always reported."
