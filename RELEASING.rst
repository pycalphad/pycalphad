Releasing pycalphad
===================

When releasing a new version of pycalphad:

1. All pull requests / issues tagged with the upcoming version milestone should be resolved or deferred.
2. Ensure that all tests pass locally on develop. Feature tests which are deferred to a future
   milestone should be marked with the ``SkipTest`` decorator.
3. Regenerate the API documentation with ``sphinx-apidoc -o docs/api/ pycalphad/``
4. Resolve differences and commit the updated API documentation to the develop branch of the repository.
5. ``git push`` and verify all tests pass on all CI services.
6. Generate a list of commits since the last version with ``git log --oneline --decorate --color 0.1^..origin/develop``
   Replace ``0.1`` with the tag of the last public version.
7. Condense the change list into something user-readable. Update and commit CHANGES.rst with the release date.
8. If you have Sphinx installed in a virtual environment with pycalphad:
   Run ``sphinx-build -b html ~/git/pycalphad/docs docs/_build/html`` to do a spot check on the docs before pushing.
9. ``git checkout master``

   ``git merge develop`` (merge commits unnecessary for now)
10. ``git pull`` to make sure you haven't missed any last-minute commits. **After this point, nothing else is making it into this version.**
   A minor release can be done later if something important is missed.
11. ``git stash``

   ``git tag -s 0.2 master -m "Version 0.2"`` Replace ``0.2`` with the new version. pycalphad should be signed with GPG key **98628A70**.
   If you are using a hardware token on Linux, you may need to ``killall -1 gpg-agent`` for it to be detected.

   ``git show 0.2`` to ensure the correct commit was tagged and signed

   ``git tag -v 0.2`` to verify the GPG signature

   ``git push origin master --tags``

   ``git stash pop``
12. ``asv run 0.2^..0.2`` to run a benchmark for the new release. Compare the results using ``asv publish && asv preview`` and navigating to
   [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/). If there are no regressions, commit and push the new benchmark files and rendered html.
13. The new version is tagged in the repository. Now the public package must be built and distributed.

Uploading to PyPI
-----------------
1. ``rm -R dist/*`` on Linux/OSX or ``del dist/*`` on Windows
2. With the commit checked out which was tagged with the new version:
   ``python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel``

   **Make sure that the script correctly detected the new version exactly and not a dirty / revised state of the repo.**

   Assuming a correctly configured .pypirc:
   ``twine upload -r pypi --sign -u rotis -i 98628A70 dist/*``

Uploading to Anaconda.org
-------------------------
Start with the commit checked out which was tagged with the new version.

1. ``rm /home/rotis/anaconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pycalphad-*.tar.bz2`` on Linux/OSX (use ``del`` and correct path on Windows)
2. ``rm -R dist/*`` on Linux/OSX or ``del dist/*`` on Windows
3. ``conda build --python 2.7 conda_recipe/``

   ``conda build --python 3.4 conda_recipe/``

   ``conda build --python 3.5 conda_recipe/``

4. ``conda convert --platform all /home/rotis/anaconda/conda-bld/linux-64/pycalphad-*.tar.bz2 -o ./dist``
5. ``anaconda upload -u richardotis dist/*/*``
